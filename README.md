# MATH5110 Numerical Optimization and Matrix Analysis

## Problem Set Topics
- Flop-complexity assessments for LU factorization with multiple right-hand sides, including LDU refinements and permutation-driven elimination sequences.

- Finite-field and real interpolation framed via Gaussian elimination/RREF, comparing standard and tailored polynomial bases.

- Reconstruction of a Shamir secret via Lagrange interpolation with finite-field computation strategies.

- Group theory analyses of Z_6 that separate its additive abelian behavior from the failure of multiplicative invertibility in the same ring.

- Arithmetic in quadratic number fields and advanced linear-algebraic considerations such as determinant- and trace-defined subspaces, direct-sum decompositions, and quotient-space bases.
