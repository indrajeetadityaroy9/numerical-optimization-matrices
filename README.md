# MATH5110 Numerical Optimization and Matrix Analysis

**Problem Set 1**
- LU/Gaussian elimination flop counts (multiplies/divides) for an n×n system.
- Forward/back substitution costs; reuse of a single LU for multiple right‑hand sides vs repeated elimination.
- LDU factorization with row swaps; permutation matrices in elimination.
- RREF conditions and computation on small examples.

**Problem Set 2**
- Shamir secret reconstruction via Lagrange interpolation over a finite field (mod 257).
- Quadratic number field arithmetic: Q(√2) is a field (closure, inverses, representation a + b√2).
- Subspace tests in M2×2: sets defined by determinant 0 and trace 0 (closure under addition/scalar multiples).
- Quotient space basics: cosets and bases for R3/W.
- Z6 structure: (Z6, +) is an abelian group; (Z6 \ {0}, ×) fails to be a group ⇒ Z6 is a ring but not a field.

**Problem Set 3**
- Linear maps on polynomial spaces: kernel, image, Rank–Nullity verification.
- Matrix representations relative to bases; change‑of‑basis matrices and coordinates.
- Determinant tests for invertibility; isomorphisms via invertible representations.
- Worked examples: permutation linear map on R3; Laplace expansion to analyze det and invertibility.

**Problem Set 4**
- Graph adjacency matrices: A^ℓ counts walks of length ℓ; graph distances via powers of A.
- Degree from (A^2)ii; complete graph adjacency J − I; counts of 2‑ and 3‑walks in K_n.
- Graph isomorphism via degree multisets and explicit permutation ϕ; matrix relation P^T A_G P = A_H.
- Incidence matrix Q: Null(Q) are vectors constant on each connected component.
- Intro coding theory: Hamming (7,4) and (6,3) codes, minimum distance, detect/correct capability, decoding ambiguity.

**Problem Set 5**
- Complex inner products; Gram–Schmidt and orthonormal bases in C^3.
- Constructing new inner products from sums/differences; when definiteness fails.
- Cauchy–Schwarz in function spaces with ⟨f,g⟩ = ∫ f g.
- Orthogonal complements, projections, and decomposition; projection formulas in finite dimensions.

**Problem Set 6**
- Riesz representation in finite‑dimensional inner product spaces: represent T(f)=f(0) as ⟨f,g⟩ on span{1,x,x^2} with [−1,1] weight.
- Adjoint operators: identities and properties; uniqueness; (ST)† = T†S†, (I)† = I.
- Least‑squares approximation and normal equations for single‑parameter fits.

**Problem Set 7**
- Norm relations on R^n: ∥v∥_2^2 ≤ ∥v∥_1∥v∥_∞ and ∥v∥_2^2 ≤ n∥v∥_∞^2.
- Tridiagonal Toeplitz determinant recurrence; closed form det(B_n) = n + 1.
- Eigenvalues/eigenspaces of idempotents (T^2 = T): spectrum {0,1}; diagonalization and effect of adding I.
- Eigenstructure of the all‑ones matrix: eigenvalues 0 and n; commuting with diagonal matrices; matrix square roots for diagonal D.

**Problem Set 8**
- Eigenvalues, eigenspaces, generalized eigenspaces; constructing Jordan chains and Jordan bases.
- Determining Jordan forms from characteristic polynomials and ranks of powers; block counts from nullities.
- Cayley–Hamilton applications; nilpotent matrices have only eigenvalue 0.
